Skipper ships your code, it does it with style.

**Components**

Add your suggestions here, Personally I think we need these Features

  - Log of all deploys
  - Links to github diffs
  - Calendar showing the deploys (ical response, combined with google calendar widget?)
  - Page which queries the deploy state of all machines (4 webservers on v200000, 3 on v200111 etc)
  - Interface to do standard deploys


We would need to store
  - Environments
  - Deploys
  - Users (Via github oauth)
